## Technologies Used

The components of [React Native Messaging App ](http://market.nativebase.io/view/react-native-messaging-app-with-backend) are built using the core components of [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) and [NativeBase](http://nativebase.io/docs/v0.4.6/).
Taxi App also constantly incorporates various other lastest technologies.

* React Native
* NativeBase
* Mobx
* CodePush


## [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)
React Native helps in making the development work easier and allowing the developers to focus on the core app features in every new release. It is the fastest-developing mobile app development that essentially permits you to create an isolated product with often outcomes.
The hymn of React Native â€” **learn once, write anywhere**.
React Native takes charge of the view controllers and programatically generates native views using javascript. This means that you can have all the speed and power of a native application, with the ease of development that comes with React.


## [NativeBase](http://nativebase.io/docs/v0.4.6/)
NativeBase is an open source framework from the team of [StrapMobile](https://strapmobile.com/).
This framework enable developers to build high-quality mobile apps using [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) iOS and Android apps with a fusion of [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features). NativeBase builds a layer on top of React Native that provides you with basic set of components for mobile application development. The applications stack of components is built using native UI components and because of that, there are no compromises with the User Experience of the applications. NativeBase is targeted specially on the look and feel, and UI interplay of your app.
NativeBase without a doubt fits in well with mobile applications which cut downs one huge part of your app - The Front end.

## [Mobx](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx)
State is the heart of each application and there is no quicker way to create buggy, unmanageable applications than by producing inconsistent state. Or state that is out-of-sync with local variables that linger around. Hence many state management solutions try to restrict the ways in which you can modify state, for example by making state immutable. But this introduces new problems; data needs to be normalized, referential integrity can no longer be guaranteed and it becomes next to impossible to use powerful concepts like prototypes.

[Mobx](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) makes state management simple again by addressing the root issue: it makes it impossible to produce an inconsistent state. The strategy to achieve that is simple: _Make sure that everything that can be derived from the application state, will be derived. Automatically._

Making an app reactive using [Mobx](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) boils down to just these three steps:
1. Define your state and make it observable
2. Create a view that responds to changes in the State
3. Modify the State

##[CodePush](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push)
[React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) app is composed of JavaScript files, images, which are bundled together by the packager and distributed as part of a platform-specific binary (i.e. an .ipa or .apk file). Once the app is released, updating either the JavaScript code or image assets, requires you to recompile and redistribute the entire binary.
The CodePush plugin helps get product improvements in front of your end users instantly, with the aid of preserving your javascript and images synchronized with updates you launch to the CodePush server. This way, your app gets the benefits of an offline mobile experience, as well as the "web-like" agility of side-loading updates as soon as they are available.
