# Components

[NativeBase](http://nativebase.io/) is made from effective building blocks referred to as components. The Components are constructed in pure [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) platform along with some JavaScript functionality with rich set of customisable properties. These components allow you to quickly build the perfect interface.
